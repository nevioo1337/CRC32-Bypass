# CRC32-Bypass
This is a method of bypassing memory integrity checks
- You can theoretically also just patch as fast as possible if there are not too many patches and then you don't have to suspend the process (useful if you want to bypass anti debug)

## How does it work?
- Create process & suspend it
- Patch bytes
- Resume process
